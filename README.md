# [AS202585](https://as202585.net) peering list

AS202585 has an open peering policy. We do however follow some guidelines for peering requests:

   * You should have a public ASN with at least 1 globally routable IPv4 or IPv6 prefix.
   * Your IRR entries should be up-to-date.
   * Your PeeringDB entry should be up-to-date.

I’m willing to peer at all IXPs we have in common.

If you’re ready. Create a pull reques and add yourself to the list.
